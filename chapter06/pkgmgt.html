        Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book. A
        Package Manager allows tracking the installation of files making it
        easy to remove and upgrade packages. As well as the binary and
        library files, a package manager will handle the installation of
        configuration files. Before you begin to wonder, NO&mdash;this
        section will not talk about nor recommend any particular package
        manager. What it provides is a roundup of the more popular techniques
        and how they work. The perfect package manager for you may be among
        these techniques or may be a combination of two or more of these
        techniques. This section briefly mentions issues that may arise when
        upgrading packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some reasons why no package manager is mentioned in LFS or BLFS
        include:

          6.3.1. Upgrade Issues
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions when
          they are released. Generally the instructions in the LFS and BLFS
          Book can be used to upgrade to the newer versions. Here are some
          points that you should be aware of when upgrading packages,
          especially on a running system.

                If Glibc needs to be upgraded to a newer version, (e.g. from
                glibc-2.19 to glibc-2.20, it is safer to rebuild LFS. Though
                you <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to
                rebuild all the packages in their dependency order, we do not
                recommend it.

            <li class="listitem">

                If a package containing a shared library is updated, and if
                the name of the library changes, then all the packages
                dynamically linked to the library need to be recompiled to
                link against the newer library. (Note that there is no
                correlation between the package version and the name of the
                library.) For example, consider a package foo-1.2.3 that
                installs a shared library with name <code class=
                "filename">libfoo.so.1</code>. Say you upgrade the package to
                a newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared library with
                name <code class="filename">libfoo.so.2</code>. In this case,
                all packages that are dynamically linked to <code class=
                "filename">libfoo.so.1</code> need to be recompiled to link
                against <code class="filename">libfoo.so.2</code>. Note that
                you should not remove the previous libraries until the
                dependent packages are recompiled.

          6.3.2. Package Management Techniques
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following are some common package management techniques. Before
          making a decision on a package manager, do some research on the
          various techniques, particularly the drawbacks of the particular
          scheme.

            6.3.2.1. It is All in My Head!
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not
            find the need for a package manager because they know the
            packages intimately and know what files are installed by each
            package. Some users also do not need any package management
            because they plan on rebuilding the entire system when a package
            is changed.

            6.3.2.2. Install in Separate Directories
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a simplistic package management that does not need any
            extra package to manage the installations. Each package is
            installed in a separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1
            is installed in <code class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</code>
            and a symlink is made from <code class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg/foo</code> to <code class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</code>. When installing a new version
            foo-1.2, it is installed in <code class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.2</code> and the previous symlink is
            replaced by a symlink to the new version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Environment variables such as <code class="envar">PATH</code>,
            <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, <code class=
            "envar">MANPATH</code>, <code class="envar">INFOPATH</code> and
            <code class="envar">CPPFLAGS</code> need to be expanded to
            include <code class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</code>. For more than
            a few packages, this scheme becomes unmanageable.

        <div class="sect3">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            6.3.2.3. Symlink Style Package Management
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a variation of the previous package management technique.
            Each package is installed similar to the previous scheme. But
            instead of making the symlink, each file is symlinked into the
            <code class="filename">/usr</code> hierarchy. This removes the
            need to expand the environment variables. Though the symlinks can
            be created by the user to automate the creation, many package
            managers have been written using this approach. A few of the
            popular ones include Stow, Epkg, Graft, and Depot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The installation needs to be faked, so that the package thinks
            that it is installed in <code class="filename">/usr</code> though
            in reality it is installed in the <code class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg</code> hierarchy. Installing in this manner
            is not usually a trivial task. For example, consider that you are
            installing a package libfoo-1.1. The following instructions may
            not install the package properly:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1
make
make install</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not
            link to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package that
            links against libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
            <code class="filename">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</code>
            instead of <code class="filename">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</code> as
            you would expect. The correct approach is to use the <code class=
            "envar">DESTDIR</code> strategy to fake installation of the
            package. This approach works as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            Most packages support this approach, but there are some which do
            not. For the non-compliant packages, you may either need to
            manually install the package, or you may find that it is easier
            to install some problematic packages into <code class=
            "filename">/opt</code>.

            6.3.2.4. Timestamp Based
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this technique, a file is timestamped before the installation
            of the package. After the installation, a simple use of the
            <span class="command"><strong>find</strong></span> command with
            the appropriate options can generate a log of all the files
            installed after the timestamp file was created. A package manager
            written with this approach is install-log.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has two
            drawbacks. If, during installation, the files are installed with
            any timestamp other than the current time, those files will not
            be tracked by the package manager. Also, this scheme can only be
            used when one package is installed at a time. The logs are not
            reliable if two packages are being installed on two different
            consoles.

            6.3.2.5. Tracing Installation Scripts
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this approach, the commands that the installation scripts
            perform are recorded. There are two techniques that one can use:
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code class="envar">LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable
            can be set to point to a library to be preloaded before
            installation. During installation, this library tracks the
            packages that are being installed by attaching itself to various
            executables such as <span class=
            "command"><strong>cp</strong></span>, <span class=
            "command"><strong>install</strong></span>, <span class=
            "command"><strong>mv</strong></span> and tracking the system
            calls that modify the filesystem. For this approach to work, all
            the executables need to be dynamically linked without the suid or
            sgid bit. Preloading the library may cause some unwanted
            side-effects during installation. Therefore, it is advised that
            one performs some tests to ensure that the package manager does
            not break anything and logs all the appropriate files.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second technique is to use <span class=
            "command"><strong>strace</strong></span>, which logs all system
            calls made during the execution of the installation scripts.

            6.3.2.6. Creating Package Archives
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a separate
            tree as described in the Symlink style package management. After
            the installation, a package archive is created using the
            installed files. This archive is then used to install the package
            either on the local machine or can even be used to install the
            package on other machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is used by most of the package managers found in
            the commercial distributions. Examples of package managers that
            follow this approach are RPM (which, incidentally, is required by
            the <a class="ulink" href=
            "http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml">Linux Standard
            Base Specification</a>), pkg-utils, Debian's apt, and Gentoo's
            Portage system. A hint describing how to adopt this style of
            package management for LFS systems is located at <a class="ulink"

          </p>
          <p>
            Creation of package files that include dependency information is
            complex and is beyond the scope of LFS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slackware uses a <span class=
            "command"><strong>tar</strong></span> based system for package
            archives. This system purposely does not handle package
            dependencies as more complex package managers do. For details of

          <p>
            This scheme, unique to LFS, was devised by Matthias Benkmann, and

            "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/list.html">Hints

            separate user into the standard locations. Files belonging to a
            package are easily identified by checking the user ID. The
            features and shortcomings of this approach are too complex to

          6.3.3. Deploying LFS on Multiple Systems
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the advantages of an LFS system is that there are no files
          that depend on the position of files on a disk system. Cloning an
          LFS build to another computer with an architecture similar to the
          base system is as simple as using <span class=
          "command"><strong>tar</strong></span> on the LFS partition that
          contains the root directory (about 250MB uncompressed for a base
          LFS build), copying that file via network transfer or CD-ROM to the
          new system and expanding it. From that point, a few configuration
          files will have to be changed. Configuration files that may need to
          be updated include: <code class="filename">/etc/hosts</code>,
          <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/passwd</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/group</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/shadow</code>, and <code class=
          "filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A custom kernel may need to be built for the new system depending
          on differences in system hardware and the original kernel
          configuration.

        <p>
          Finally the new system has to be made bootable via <a class="xref"
