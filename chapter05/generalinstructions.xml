  <title>General Compilation Instructions</title>

  <para>When building packages there are several assumptions made within
  the instructions:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Several of the packages are patched before compilation, but only when
    the patch is needed to circumvent a problem. A patch is often needed in
    both this and the next chapter, but sometimes in only one or the other.
    Therefore, do not be concerned if instructions for a downloaded patch seem
    to be missing.  Warning messages about <emphasis>offset</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>fuzz</emphasis> may also be encountered when applying a patch. Do
    not worry about these warnings, as the patch was still successfully
    applied.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>During the compilation of most packages, there will be several
    warnings that scroll by on the screen. These are normal and can safely be
    ignored.  These warnings are as they appear&mdash;warnings about
    deprecated, but not invalid, use of the C or C++ syntax. C standards change
    fairly often, and some packages still use the older standard. This is not a
    problem, but does prompt the warning.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Check one last time that the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable
    is set up properly:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

    <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the LFS partition's mount
    point, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename>, using our
    example.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Finally, two last important items must be emphasized:</para>

    <important>

      <para>The build instructions assume that the <xref
      linkend='pre-hostreqs'/>, including symbolic links, have been set
      properly:</para>

      <itemizedlist role='important'>

        <listitem override='bullet'><para><command>bash</command> is the shell
        in use.</para></listitem>

        <listitem override='bullet'><para><command>sh</command> is a symbolic
        link to <command>bash</command>.</para></listitem>

        <listitem override='bullet'><para><command>/usr/bin/awk</command> is a
        symbolic link to <command>gawk</command>.</para></listitem>

        <listitem override='bullet'><para><command>/usr/bin/yacc</command> is a
        symbolic link to <command>bison</command> or a small script that
        executes bison.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
    </important>

    <important>
      <para>To re-emphasize the build process:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="arabic" spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>Place all the sources and patches in a directory that will be
          accessible from the chroot environment such as
          <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs/sources/</filename>.  Do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> put sources in
          <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs/tools/</filename>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Change to the sources directory.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem id='buildinstr' xreflabel='Package build instructions'>
          <para>For each package:</para>
          <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha" spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para>Using the <command>tar</command> program, extract the package
              to be built.  In Chapter 5, ensure you are the <emphasis>lfs</emphasis>
              user when extracting the package.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>

              extracted.</para>
