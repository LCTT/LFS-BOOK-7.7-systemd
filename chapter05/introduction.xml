  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build a minimal Linux system.
  This system will contain just enough tools to start constructing the final
  LFS system in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/> and allow a working
  environment with more user convenience than a minimum environment would.</para>

  <para>There are two steps in building this minimal system. The first step
  is to build a new and host-independent toolchain (compiler, assembler,
  linker, libraries, and a few useful utilities).  The second step uses this
  toolchain to build the other essential tools.</para>

  <para>The files compiled in this chapter will be installed under the
  <filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> directory to keep them
  separate from the files installed in the next chapter and the host
  production directories. Since the packages compiled here are temporary,
  we do not want them to pollute the soon-to-be LFS system.</para>
