  <title>Stripping</title>

  <para>The steps in this section are optional, but if the LFS partition is
  rather small, it is beneficial to learn that unnecessary items can be removed.
  The executables and libraries built so far contain about 70 MB of unneeded
  debugging symbols. Remove those symbols with:</para>

<screen><userinput>strip --strip-debug /tools/lib/*
/usr/bin/strip --strip-unneeded /tools/{,s}bin/*</userinput></screen>

  <para>These commands will skip a number of files, reporting that it does not
  recognize their file format. Most of these are scripts instead of binaries.
  Also use the system strip command to include the strip binary in /tools.</para>

  <para>Take care <emphasis>not</emphasis> to use
  <parameter>--strip-unneeded</parameter> on the libraries. The static
  ones would be destroyed and the toolchain packages would need to be
  built all over again.</para>

  <para>To save more, remove the documentation:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /tools/{,share}/{info,man,doc}</userinput></screen>

  <para>At this point, you should have at least 3 GB of free space in
  <envar>$LFS</envar> that can be used to build and install Glibc and Gcc in
  the next phase. If you can build and install Glibc, you can build and install
  the rest too.</para>
