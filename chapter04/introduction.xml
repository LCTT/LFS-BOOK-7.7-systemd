  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare
  for building the temporary system. We will create a directory in
  <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename> for the installation of the
  temporary tools, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk,
  and create an appropriate build environment for that user. We will also
  explain the unit of time we use to measure how long LFS packages take to
  build, or <quote>SBUs</quote>, and give some information about package
  test suites.</para>
