  <para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para>Create an <filename>/etc/os-release</filename> file required by
  systemd:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/os-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
NAME="Linux From Scratch"
VERSION="&version;"
ID=lfs
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch &version;"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>It is recommended to create <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename>
  for compatibility with non systemd branch. By having this file, it is very
  easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find
  out which LFS version is installed on the system. Create this file by
  running:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>

  <para>It is also a good idea to create a file to show the status of your
  new system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB).  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/lsb-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="&version;"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>Be sure to put some sort of customization for the field
  'DISTRIB_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely yours.</para>
