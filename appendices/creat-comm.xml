          <para>"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
          encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
          with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
          works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
          defined below) for the purposes of this License.</para>

          <para>"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon
          the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
          arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
          recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in
          which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work
          that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
          for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
          is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work
          in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
          Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</para>

          <para>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or

          display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer
          or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
          License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
          not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
          License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
          display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
          technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
          inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
          Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
          this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
          You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
          reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You
          create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
          extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
          Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.</para>
