  <title>Mounting the New Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a file system has been created, the partition needs to
  be made accessible. In order to do this, the partition needs to be
  mounted at a chosen mount point. For the purposes of this book, it is
  assumed that the file system is mounted under the directory specified by the
  <envar>LFS</envar> envronment varibale as described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <para>Create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by running:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> with the designation of the LFS
  partition.</para>

  <para>If using multiple partitions for LFS (e.g., one for <filename
  class="directory">/</filename> and another for <filename
  class="directory">/usr</filename>), mount them using:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS
mkdir -v $LFS/usr
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> $LFS/usr</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> and
  <replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> with the appropriate partition
  names.</para>

  <para>Ensure that this new partition is not mounted with permissions that are
  too restrictive (such as the <option>nosuid</option> or
  <option>nodev</option> options). Run the <command>mount</command> command
  without any parameters to see what options are set for the mounted LFS
  partition. If <option>nosuid</option> and/or <option>nodev</option> are set,
  the partition will need to be remounted.</para>

  <para>If you are using a <systemitem
  class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition, ensure that it is enabled
  using the <command>swapon</command> command:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>/sbin/swapon -v /dev/<replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the
  <systemitem class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition.</para>

  <para>Now that there is an established place to work, it is time to
  download the packages.</para>
